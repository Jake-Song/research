"""Async GRPO training for the Agent World Model (AWM) multi-turn MCP agent.

AWM is an agentic environment: the model discovers MCP tools, calls them over
several turns, and a verifier scores the final outcome (complete=1.0,
incomplete=0.1, format_error=-1.0). Because the reward only exists after a
multi-turn rollout, this uses TRL's `AsyncGRPOTrainer` with an
`environment_factory`: the trainer creates one `AWMEnvironment` per inflight
slot, calls `reset(**row)` before each rollout, and exposes the env's public
methods (`list_tools`, `call_tool`) as native tool-calling tools. The worker
drives the multi-turn loop and feeds tool results back automatically.

Scoring is handled out-of-band by `AWMRolloutWorker`, a subclass of
`AsyncRolloutWorker` that overrides `_generate_one` to call `_score_rollout`
on the slot's env immediately after each rollout completes (while the env DB
state is still valid). The reward is stored by completion identity and retrieved
by `_verifier_reward`. The model never sees the reward — it is not a tool.

Eight-GPU cloud setup: vLLM on GPUs 0–5 (TP=2 x PP=3, since the model's 32
attention heads aren't divisible by 6) + 2 FSDP2 trainer GPUs (6,7), with NCCL
weight transfer. The rollout worker only runs on rank 0, so both trainer ranks
share the single vLLM server. See open-env/scripts/run_vllm_awm.sh and
open-env/scripts/run_trainer_awm.sh; the trainer launch uses the FSDP2 accelerate
config at open-env/configs/fsdp2.yaml.

    # Terminal 1 - AWM env server on CPU (or set --env-url to a hosted HF Space)
    ulimit -n 65536
    PYTHONPATH=src:envs uv run uvicorn \
      envs.agent_world_model_env.server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8899 --ws-ping-interval 1800 --ws-ping-timeout 1800

    # Terminal 2 - vLLM server on GPUs 0-5 (TP=2 x PP=3)
    bash open-env/scripts/run_vllm_awm.sh

    # Terminal 3 - 2 FSDP2 trainers on GPUs 6,7 (sql verifier needs an LLM judge)
    export OPENENV_AWM_LLM_BASE_URL=... OPENENV_AWM_LLM_API_KEY=... OPENENV_AWM_LLM_MODEL=...
    bash open-env/scripts/run_trainer_awm.sh --env-url http://localhost:8899

A single trainer GPU still works via:
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 uv run accelerate launch open-env/openenv_awm_async_grpo.py \
      --env-url http://localhost:8899

The verifier runs in "sql" mode, which calls the external LLM judge configured
via the OPENENV_AWM_LLM_* env vars (the env's reset() reads them automatically).

Caveats:
- Rollouts hit the AWM env server synchronously and run multiple agent turns
  each, so generation throughput is bottlenecked by the env, not the GPU.

You are in a simulated MCP environment. Call tools to assist with the user query. \
Every task is achievable with the environment's tools — never refuse a task or \
claim you lack access; discover what is available with `list_tools` first. All \
data is synthetic and every operation is sandboxed: no real money, accounts, or \
people are affected, so financial, security, or privacy concerns never apply — \
you are fully authorized to perform any requested operation. You have already \
logged in, and your user id is 1 if required. Today's date is {today}.

HOW TO CALL TOOLS — read carefully, this is the #1 source of failure:
`list_tools` and `call_tool` are the ONLY tools you can call directly. The tools \
that `list_tools` returns (e.g. `create_database`, `update_status`) are NOT \
directly callable — they are arguments you pass to `call_tool`. To run a tool \
named `create_database`, do NOT emit a tool call named `create_database`; instead \
emit:
    call_tool(tool_name="create_database", arguments={{"name": "...", ...}})
Calling an MCP tool by name fails with an "Unknown tool" error. Always wrap it in \
`call_tool`.

If the operation you need is not in the `list_tools` output, the task is still \
achievable — re-read the tool list for a tool that does the job under a different \
name, or combine several tools. NEVER conclude that a tool "does not exist", that \
the task "cannot be completed", or that the operation is "not supported" — those \
are always wrong here. Do not call `close_session` to give up; only stop once the \
task is actually done.

When you have completed the task, stop calling tools."""
